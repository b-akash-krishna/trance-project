# üè• TRANCE Project - Complete Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

**Title:** TRANCE - Temporal Readmission Analysis with Neural Clinical Embeddings

**Objective:** Build a multimodal machine learning system that predicts 30-day hospital readmissions by combining structured EHR data with clinical text embeddings from discharge summaries.

**Key Innovation:** Leveraging ClinicalT5 transformer embeddings to capture nuanced clinical information from unstructured notes, combined with traditional structured features.

## üí° Using AI Tools Effectively

### Recommended Workflow for Each Component

**For Data Processing (Notebooks 01-03):**
```
Prompt to AI: "I need to extract ICD-9 diagnosis codes from the DIAGNOSES_ICD 
table and map them to Charlson comorbidity categories. Here's my current code: 
[paste code]. How can I optimize this?"
```

**For Model Training (Notebook 05):**
```
Prompt to AI: "My LightGBM model is overfitting (train AUROC 0.95, test AUROC 0.70). 
Here are my parameters: [paste]. What regularization should I add?"
```

**For Dashboard (app.py):**
```
Prompt to AI: "I want to add a date range filter to my Streamlit dashboard that 
updates all charts. Current code: [paste]. How do I implement this?"
```

**For Debugging:**
```
Prompt to AI: "I'm getting this error when loading embeddings: [error message]. 
Here's my code: [paste]. What's wrong?"
```

### Best Practices
1. **Understand first, then modify** - Don't blindly copy-paste code
2. **Ask for explanations** - "Explain this code section: [code]"
3. **Iterative improvement** - Start simple, add features incrementally
4. **Debug systematically** - Share full error messages and relevant code
5. **Learn patterns** - Recognize common patterns you can reuse
